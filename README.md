## Running the code
    
    Download the ZIP file of the entire repository or do git clone https://github.com/EPTikhonov/TravelCalc.git
    If downloaded as ZIP file, unzip first then open index.html file. 
    
In the TravelCalculator.js file on line 11, a comment states to plug in your own API key from http://api.openweathermap.org . This is needed to get real weather data for the weather feature.

There are also many comments in the index.html file. Example: "\<!-- NOTE: This is default for Github Pages -->"\. These default values need to be removed before searching for a location's weather forcast.
