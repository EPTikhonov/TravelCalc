# TravelCalc - The Right Way Is Your Way!
Calculates travel expenses between driving or flying and displays a 5 day weather forcast using OpenWeatherMap API.
---
## Running the code
In the TravelCalculator.js file on line 11, a comment states to plug in your own API key from http://api.openweathermap.org . This is needed to get real weather data for the weather feature.

There are also many comments in the index.html file. Example: "\<!-- NOTE: This is default for Github -->"\. These default values need to be removed before searching for a location's weather forcast.
